**Chart in Bio — 100% On-Chain Link Profile**

Chart in Bio is a system similar to the well-known Linktree, but with the power of decentralization and ownership — storing 100% of profiles *on-chain* within the EVM-based Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Each profile is controlled by the user’s wallet — the address owner creates and edits their profile directly in the system. The goal: maximum data ownership, unstoppable operation, and full compatibility.

**Note:** By definition, *“100% on-chain”* means that the entire state of the profile (text, URLs, order) is recorded on the blockchain. This ensures transparency and makes all profiles public by nature.

**Main Features**

* On-chain profile creation controlled by a BSC address.
* Profile editing (name, description, emoji or emoji-hash avatar, ordered list of links).
* Public profile viewing via frontend.
* Support for data replacement.

Direct on-chain storage without backend or centralization — strings and arrays are persisted on-chain. Simple and straightforward.
